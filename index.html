                    <h4>Innovation</h4>
                    <p>Innovation has been the dominant catchword in the last few decades. It usually happens with the development of a totally novel idea, or around the alteration of existing ones, and is sometimes enough to disrupt the whole system. However, pursuing innovative ideas is about balancing opportunities against risks. There is always a chance that innovation might not work out but there are also ways to address that. </p>

                    <h4>Sustainability</h4>
                    <p>Bangladesh is one of the places on the planet most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. It is also home to a burgeoning manufacturing sector, which lifts people out of poverty, but can also contribute to environmental, health, and human rights issues for workers and surrounding communities.</p>

                    <p>Bangladesh has taken many steps to empower women, including increasing access to education, improving health care, and creating opportunities for employment. The government is also working to remove barriers to women's participation in society. </p>
